### How to use Vercions on minecraft launcher ? ###

### How to use it for MCP ###

### How to use minecraft_server.1.6.4 ###

* Create a folder and name it as you want, who cares anyways :3
* Insert the minecraft_server.1.6.4 into that folder.
* Rename it to something, if you want to, in my case, i'll rename it to Vanilla.jar
* Create a file called run.bat and insert this;

```batch
@echo off
java -Xmx1024M -jar Vanilla.jar -o true
PAUSE
```

* This will start the jar file with 1GB of ram. Feel free to change the ram. 

> `-Xmx2048M` = 2GB
> `-Xmx3072M` = 3GB
> *etc. etc. Just add 1024 to add 1GB*
